## Motivation

In the United States, the flu season usually occurs in the fall and winter, meaning people are most vulnerable to the flu during this season. However, as COVID restrictions and policies have become less stringent, we have seen a significant decrease in the number of people wearing masks. We wanted to explore how people wearing masks has an effect on disease prevalence.

## Website Overview

In the [Data Processing](https://mingeechoi.github.io/P8105-final-project-proposal/Data-cleaning--analysis.html) section, you will find:

* Description of the data 

* Our data cleaning process


In the [Exploratory Analyses](https://mingeechoi.github.io/P8105-final-project-proposal/exploratory_analysis.html) section, you will find:

* Descriptive statistics of variables used in this dataset

* Visualization of maskwearing, influenza symptoms, hospital admissions, depression, and finance over time 

* Description of overall trends in the U.S. regarding maskwearing and influenza symptoms/admissions 


In the [Map Building](https://mingeechoi.github.io/P8105-final-project-proposal/dashboard.html) section, you will find:

* An interactive map showing confirmed influenza admissions per day across the United States.

* A second interactive map showing average mask rate across the United States.


In the [Model Building](https://mingeechoi.github.io/P8105-final-project-proposal/model_building.html) section, you will find:

* The process of fitting a GEE model onto the analysis data set. 

* Detailed definition of the GEE model and how it was coded with specific parameter or options used.

* A generic function written to output the model estimates for both multiple selected states and nation-wide data. The model's covariates are also fully customizable besides the main exposure `maskwearing_prop`

  * This function was adapted for the Shiny Flexdashboard website. 
  
  * The function can also output model for either outcome variable: `admission` or `symptoms`
  

In the [Interactive Map & Model](https://mingeechoi.github.io/P8105-final-project-proposal/model_building.html) section, you will find:

* Two tabs:

  * US map with state-level annual average of selected variable of interest.
  
  * Estimated model with customizable inputs along with scatter plots for variables of interests.
