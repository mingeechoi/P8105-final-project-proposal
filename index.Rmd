## Motivation

CDC’s mask requirements have greatly evolved throughout the COVID-19 pandemic. On Feb. 29, 2020, U.S. Surgeon General Dr. Jerome Adams angrily tweeted, “Seriously people–STOP BUYING MASKS!” Since then, the CDC has published reports that masks are protective against COVID-19 and released guidelines on masking in schools and local communities. By July 2020, more than half of U.S. states had mask mandates. However, as vaccination rates spiked, the CDC eased masking guidelines, and by May 2021, fully vaccinated people weren’t required to wear a mask in most indoor and outdoor settings.  

Furthermore, COVID-19 has put a great strain on hospitals and public health facilities in the U.S. It has worsened numerous public health problems such as the flu, RSV, and norovirus. Many news outlets have recently reported that the United States is suffering one of the worst flu seasons in decades. In the United States, the flu season usually occurs in the fall and winter, meaning people are most vulnerable to the flu during this season. As COVID restrictions and policies have become less stringent, we have seen a significant decrease in the number of people wearing masks. We wanted to explore how people wearing masks has an effect on disease prevalence.

**Efficacy and Practice of Facemask Use in General Population: a Systematic Review and Meta-analysis (Li et. al., 2022)**
Ever since the COVID-19 pandemic began, numerous studies on the effectiveness of mask-wearing have been published. In a meta-analysis that summarized eight RCTs on mask-wearing effectiveness, the results suggest a significant protective effect of mask-wearing in preventing infections (Li et al, 2022  ). 
(https://www.nature.com/articles/s41398-022-01814-3)


**Effectiveness of Face Mask or Respirator Use in Indoor Public Settings for Prevention of SARS-CoV-2 Infection (Andrejko et.al, 2021)**
A study from CDC has reported that consistent use of mask or respirator in indoor settings was associated with lower odds of positive COVID-19 tests and recommends people to vaccinate and consistently wear masks or use respirators in indoor public settings.
(https://www.cdc.gov/mmwr/volumes/71/wr/mm7106e1.html)

 

**The Effect of Mask Use on the Spread of Influenza During a Pandemic (Briene et. al., 2010)**
This study examines the effects of mask efficacy and coverage on infection attack rate and basic reproduction number (R0). The results indicate that population-wide use of face masks can significantly delay the influenza pandemic and help reduce influenza outbreak.

**Need for more Robust Research on the Effectiveness of Masks in Preventing COVID-19 transmission (Li et al, 2022)**
However more robust research is still needed since mask-wearing in public can be a complex public health topic that intertwines with policy-making, public perspectives, etc. An RCT without taking into account real-world data would be too preliminary for supporting and implementing such public health policy.

## Initial Questions
Our initial questions are: 

  1. Would wearing a mask prevent us from getting an airborne infectious disease? In this case, we are spe​​cifically looking at influenza. 
  2. On a broader public health aspect, is a mask mandate policy necessary in the midst of a pandemic? Regarding the shortage of PPE among healthcare workers, should the allocation of masks pivot toward them instead of the public?

  * This function was adapted for the Shiny Flexdashboard website. 
  
  * The function can also output model for either outcome variable: `admission` or `symptoms`
